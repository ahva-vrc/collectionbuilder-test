It was built by Castilian Christians on the site of an Abbadid Muslim alcazar, or residential fortress. The fortress was destroyed after the Christian conquest of Seville. The palace is a preeminent example of Mudéjar architecture in the Iberian Peninsula but features Gothic, Renaissance and Romanesque design elements from previous stages of construction.

In this painting El Greco demonstrates his ability to combine complex political iconographies with orthodox medieval purposes. El Greco was asked for clarity and decorum for the depiction of martyrdom, but he not only moves it to second place, but he does so with an inappropriate serenity and without seeing the death of Saint Maurice, placing as the main motive the moment in which the saint convinces his companions to remain faithful to their faith in Christ. With this painting, El Greco failed forever in his attempts to obtain the royal patronage of Philip II, and his martyrdom eventually relegated to a secondary residence of the Monastery, the Chamber of Layers or Sacristy of Choir.","Monasteries--Spain; Escorial; San Lorenzo de El Escorial (Spain);

 made most effort to create a complex and credible composition that 
would convey a sense of life and reality while enclosing a dense network
 of meanings. From the writer on art Antonio Palomino we know that it 
was painted in 1656 in the Cuarto del Príncipe in the Alcázar in Madrid,
 which is the room seen in the work. He also identifies most of the 
figures of the court servants grouped around the Infanta Margarita, who 
is attended by two of the Queen`s meninas or maids-of-honour: María 
Agustina Sarmiento and Isabel de Velasco. In addition to that group, we 
also see the artist himself working on a large canvas, the dwarves Mari 
Bárbola and Nicolasito Pertusato, the latter provoking a mastiff, and 
the lady-in-waiting Marcela de Ulloa next to a guardadamas (attendant), 
with the chamberlain José Nieto standing in the doorway in the 
background. Reflected in the mirror are the faces of Philip IV and 
Mariana of Austria, the Infanta`s parents who are watching the scene 
taking place. The figures inhabit a space that is modelled not just 
through the laws of scientific perspective but also through aerial 
perspective. In the definition of this space the multiplication of the 
light sources plays an important role. ","María Ana, of Austria, Queen, consort of Philip IV, King of Spain, 1634-1696; Philip IV, King of Spain, 1605-1665; Painting--Spain--17th C.

It includes a rarely depicted veintena section (whose existence as a 
pre-Conquest manuscript subject has been questioned), a masterfully 
drawn tonalamatl featuring iconographically complex deities, and a 
pictorial chronicle that contributes invaluable data to the historical 
record. Although the confused nature of some of the glosses necessitates
 their judicious use, the annotations have provided critical information
 about both pre-and post-Conquest life. Those of the tonalamatl, for 
example, gave Eduard Seler one of the keys to identifying the deities of
 the Aztec pantheon. The images and texts of the Codex
